# Data-Analysis-on-under-5-child-mortality-using-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-SVM-Logistic-Regression

The data is secondary data taken from NHFS [National Family Health Survey]-2018 of Uttar Pradesh, India.
My approach for this analysis was based on ML Techniques. I used Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM Classifier. 
### For Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROC, Accuracy and Precision was used.
I have also tried to find the risk factors responsible for under 5 child mortality.
